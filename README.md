# Titanic Survival Prediction – Streamlit Web App

## Overview
This project is a **machine learning web application** built using **Streamlit** that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic dataset.  
The app allows users to input passenger details and receive a survival prediction based on a trained model.

The project is intended for learning, demonstration, and experimentation with classical machine learning workflows.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Titanic dataset (Kaggle)
- **Target variable:** `Survived`
- **Features used:**  
  - Passenger class  
  - Sex  
  - Age  
  - Fare  
  - Number of siblings/spouses  
  - Number of parents/children  
  - Embarked port  

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)
- Model training using classical ML algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using accuracy metrics
- Trained model used for real-time prediction via Streamlit UI

## Application Features
- Interactive input fields for passenger data
- Real-time survival prediction
- Simple and clean web interface
- Runs locally without external services
